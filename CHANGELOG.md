> **Use commands with a `/cmd ` prefix, otherwise your message gets leaked.** So if you were to type `/bt 4 snitch`, you would now type `/cmd bt 4 snitch`. The system will NOT spam the chat after command usage even if it would be required.

- Fixed translations not loading
- Widened the lines in the Preset Explorer so the text fits into the box
- Fixed add-on limit ignoring setting
